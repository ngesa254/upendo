A gentle Introduction to RAG with Gemini and Langchains


## Session abstract

Developers will dive into the world of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) with this comprehensive workshop. They will be guided through the process of using LangChain and the Gemini API to effectively retrieve and generate information.

### Key takeaways:

- Gemini fundamentals: Understand the capabilities, limitations, and different models within the Gemini family.
- LangChain mastery: Learn how to use LangChain to load, store, and retrieve documents for information retrieval.
- RAG pipelines: Build pipelines that combine retrieval and generation to answer complex queries.
- Gemini Vision integration: Discover how to integrate Gemini's vision capabilities into your RAG applications.
- Q&A chatbots: Create intelligent chatbots capable of interacting with stored documents.
- Vector DB: Explore the role of Vector DB in building scalable RAG systems.

This workshop will provide developers, engineers and researchers with a solid foundation in using Gemini and LangChain for RAG applications.
