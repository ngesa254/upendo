    "### LangChain on Vertex AI (Preview) lets you use the LangChain open source library to build custom Generative AI applications and use Vertex AI for models, tools and deployment. With LangChain on Vertex AI (Preview), you can do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Select the large language model (LLM) that you want to work with.\n",
    "2. Define tools to access external APIs.\n",
    "3. tructure the interface between the user and the system components in an orchestration framework.\n",
    "4. Deploy the framework to a managed runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "Benefits\n",
    "\n",
    "- Customizable: By utilizing LangChain's standardized interfaces, LangChain on Vertex AI can be adopted to build different kinds of applications. You can customize the logic of your application and incorporate any framework, providing a high degree of flexibility.\n",
    "- Simplifies deployment: LangChain on Vertex AI uses the same APIs as LangChain to interact with LLMs and build applications. LangChain on Vertex AI simplifies and speeds up deployment with Vertex AI LLMs since the Reasoning Engine runtime supports single click deployment to generate compliant API based on your library.\n",
    "- Integration with Vertex AI ecosystems: Reasoning Engine for LangChain on Vertex AI uses Vertex AI's infrastructure and prebuilt containers to help you deploy of your LLM application. You can use the Vertex AI API to integrate with Gemini models, Function Calling, and Extensions.\n",
    "- Secure, private, and scalable: You can use a single SDK call instead of managing the development process on your own. The Reasoning Engine managed runtime frees you from tasks such as application server development, container creation, and configuration of authentication, IAM, and scaling. Vertex AI handles autoscaling, regional expansion, and container vulnerabilities."
